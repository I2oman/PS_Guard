# PS Guard

## Overview
This project was my first experience learning **Django**. It was a great way to understand how to build web applications with Python.

## Limitations
Unfortunately, the **PSNAWP** library does not provide information about user trophies anymore. To fully implement this feature, I will need to create my own API in the future.

## Inspiration
I took inspiration from [**psnprofiles.com**](https://psnprofiles.com) for the idea behind this project.

## Next Steps
- Develop a custom API to fetch and display user trophy data.
- Enhance functionality and performance based on feedback.
